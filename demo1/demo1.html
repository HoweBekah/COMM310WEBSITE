        <h2>An Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Falconry</em> is the use of trained raptors for game hunting.
          Traditionally, the term "falcon" referred to a <em>female</em> bird,
          which were favored for hunting (due to their larger size), while the
          term tiercel described a male bird. The term "falcon" now applies to
          any bird (male or female) belonging to a species of raptor in the
          genus <em>Falco</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sport has a long history and was regarded as a status symbol among
          the nobles of medieval Europe, the Middle East, and Mongolian Empire
          due to the necessary commitments of time, money and space. According
          to Wikipedia,
          <q
            >Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194â€“1250) is generally acknowledged
            as the most significant wellspring of traditional falconry
            knowledge.</q
          >
          He is believed to have obtained firsthand knowledge of Arabic falconry
          during wars in the region. He commissioned and edited the translation
          of Moamyn's manual on falconry, known in Latin as
          <em>De Scientia Venandi per Aves</em>, and eventually wrote his own
          treatise on falconry, <em>De arte venandi cum avibus</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rise of firearms led to the decline of the popularity of falconry,
          but it is still practiced around the world. Advances in technology and
          vetrinary practices have allowed modern falconers to pursue quarry and
          styles of flight that would previously have resulted in the loss of
          their birds.

          Despite the terminology, falconry is not limited to just falcons.
          Throughout history, many different types of raptors have been kept and
          trained for hunting. Over time, falconers have come to class them in
          <del>four</del> <ins>three</ins> general categories.

          <li>
