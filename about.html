            <p> My name is <b>Bekah Howe</b> and I <b>LOVE</b> TV shows and movies! For the majority of my
                life you
                could catch me
                sitting in front of the TV watching pretty much anything I could find to watch. I know, I know. I
                should
                have been outside running around and getting dirty but there's an important thing you should know about
                me...I was born a little bit different. In my right leg, I don't have a fibula(that's the bone in the
                back
                of the bottom half of your leg), nor an ACL, PCL, other structural tendons and ligaments, ankle, I'm
                missing
                2 toes, and that leg was 1/3 shorter and my foot was smaller than my left at birth. Sounds pretty
                insane,
                right?</p>
            <p>
                To help with some of the issues caused by missing all of those parts, the short leg, and little foot I
                had quite a
                bit
                of
                surgery; like I don't
                even know how many surgeries I have had in my life. A couple of the surgeries were to lengthen my little
                leg
                by attaching an external fixator, breaking the tibia, slowly pulling the bone apart, and then wait for
                the bone to grow back between the broken pieces of bone. It was an
                extremely
                painful process and I had that external fixator, or cage as I like to say, on 3 different times. Those
                times
                were when I was 2, 13, and 14 years old. To make it so I could walk, my foot was fused to my tibia so my
                range of motion is limited. As you can imagine, I spent copious amounts of time laid up, unable to
                move, and thus started my love of
                entertainment!</p>
            <p>I want to share my love of movies and tv shows with others by providing a place to find fun, random facts
                about their favorite
                shows and movies. I may not be the best at remembering when all my siblings birthdays are (I'm the
                youngest of 10), but I sure can tell you off-the-wall factoids about celebrities, shows, and movies.
                I figured I might as well put my random knowledge to good use and sharing it with the world! So enjoy
                the randomness that is provided by this site! </p>
            <p> **Featured pup is my dog Jett! He snuggles with me while I enjoy movies
                and shows!
