                        <li>The rule of Hades is one of James Woods' all-time favorite characters. So much so, any time
                            Disney needs him to reprise the character for any cartoon show and video game, such as
                            Hercules: The Series or Kingdom Hearts, he has agreed to do so. When this film was about to
                            go over-budget, he offered to refund his salary and finish the film for free. Disney decided
                            against this, and finished the film anyway.</li>
