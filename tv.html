                    <li>The character "Penelope Garcia" was supposed to be in only one episode, but she tested so
                        positively that she was added to the main cast.</li>
                    <li>Matthew Gray Gubler does not wear matching socks, because he thinks it's unlucky. In a few of
                        the episodes, you can see his mismatched socks.</li>
                    <li>J.J.'s children are played by A.J. Cook's actual children, Mekhai Andersen and Phoenix Anderson.
                        Thomas Gibson's son Travis Gibson appeared in an episode that he directed. Joe Mantegna's
                        daughter Gia Mantegna made a few guest appearances.</li>

                    <li>Andy was only supposed to appear as a guest in the first season, but everybody liked Chris Pratt
                        so much, he was promoted to series regular for season two.</li>
                    <li>Amy Poehler, afraid they were going to turn Leslie Knope into a "female Michael Scott,"
                        requested that starting in season 2, they show her character to be talented and successful at
                        her job, with the humor coming from her quirky behavior and eager enthusiasm. The writers
                        listened and went that route starting in season 2.</li>
                    <li>Nick Offerman originally auditioned for the role of Mark Brendanawicz before being cast as Ron
                        Swanson.</li>
