              Amy Poehler, afraid they were going to turn Leslie Knope into a
              "female Michael Scott," requested that starting in season 2,
              they show her character to be talented and successful at her
              job, with the humor coming from her quirky behavior and eager
              enthusiasm. The writers listened and went that route starting in
              season 2.
